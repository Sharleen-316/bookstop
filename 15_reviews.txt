is there a sequel...please say yes?
that age gap made me wildly uncomfy
kinda made me wannt unzip my skin and crawl right out of it
too much for my lil brain
Does this book deliver? YES!
Yes, I cried. Like a goddamn baby.
In awe of where TJ took Ox's character
One og TJ's best works to date
Easily one of my all-time favorite books.
