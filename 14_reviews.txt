So many things wrong with this book
LOVED IT.
don't expect grand world-building.
Characters were boring and one-dimensional
Plot was profoundly lacking. More like, there was NONE.
Stay away from this if you prefer safe reads.
This book owned me. Completely.
had some issues with it, but OMG IT WAS GOOD!
Disappointed in this book
